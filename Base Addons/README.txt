If you are trying to install addons for Minimalist HUD Ultimate:
	DO NOT DO IT HERE!
Yes, it will technically work, but when you update MHUDU, they will be deleted.
Instead, place them in the other addons folder, here:
	
	/PAYDAY 2/mods/saves/MHUDU Addons/
	
These files are not affected when mods update.
If it doesn't exist,
	then either launch the game (it should be generated automatically when you launch with MHUDU installed),
	or create the folder yourself.
