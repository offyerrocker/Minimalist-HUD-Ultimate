If you are trying to install addons for Minimalist HUD Ultimate:
	DO NOT DO IT HERE!
Yes, it will technically work, but when you update MHUDU, they will be deleted.
Instead, place them in the addons folder, located in the /mods/saves/ folder. These files are not affected when mods update.
The full filepath is here:
	
	/PAYDAY 2/mods/saves/MHUDU Addons/
	
If it doesn't exist,
	then either launch the game (it should be generated automatically when you launch with MHUDU installed),
	or create the folder yourself.
