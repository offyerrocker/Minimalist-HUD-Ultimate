todo:
	- only load assets for enabled addons
	- go over enabled/disabled mid-heist behavior
		- require restart to affect changes? or only for enabling addons? <-- probably this
		- destroy addon panels and call unregister listeners when addon is to be removed (ie when user disables it)
		- implement destroy function
	- hud categories
		- re-check categories at any change (user changing any addon toggles)
	- toggle/button for manually enabling/disabling an addon
	- dynamically generate menus to enable/disable any addons
	



post-release:
	- auto-updater for addons
		-backport to ach






concepts:


	- every 5 minutes, a new hud element appears
	- favor elements that have not been picked (sort by tag)



	hud element categories:
		actual:
			- health
			- ammo
			- deployables
			- grenades/ability
			- armor
			- teammates
			- mission equipment 
			- cable ties
			- hostages
			
		not very useful:
			- crosshair
			- pagers
			- money
			- level
			- loot
			- chat?
			
		completely superfluous:
			- date / time
			- temperature
			- killstreak
